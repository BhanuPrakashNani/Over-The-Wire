Number-Lock Action
------------------
You are almost on Semtex 3, there is just one big door before you.
It is locked with a number lock.
**Analyze** and use the locks in /semtex/semtex3 to adjust all the
numbers in the correct way.
They will open your way to the next level.

Tip :
**If you are not good at math, you should consider brute force.
Rewrite the program and try all possible combinations of the locks.
It wont take more than a few seconds ;)**
