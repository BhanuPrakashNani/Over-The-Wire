Ptrace your way
---------------

Pass prints the password for the level you are on. Try to make it print
the next level's password.
This time it is not so easy:

    /semtex/semtex4: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), statically linked, for GNU/Linux 2.6.15, stripped

Tip :
-   Pass uses geteuid() to get its information.
-   Read man ptrace
