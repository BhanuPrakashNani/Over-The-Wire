This level utilises code from several places. The main vulnerable code
lies in a 3rd party library. The other code present may allow you to
more easily gain code execution.

The library code can be found in /drifter/drifter14_src/

If you're feeling kind hearted, you may wish to tell the developer of
the bugs you found in the library code :-)
